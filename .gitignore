# 1. IGNORE ALL FILES AND SUBDIRECTORIES IN ALL DIRECTORIES
# The pattern '**/*' matches all files and directories recursively,
# starting from the root of the repository.
**/*

# 2. EXCEPTION: DO NOT IGNORE DIRECTORIES
# This is crucial. Git ignores contents of a directory if the directory
# itself is ignored. We must un-ignore all directories recursively ('/**/')
# to allow the next rule to function.
!**/

# 3. EXCEPTION: DO NOT IGNORE .gitkeep FILES
# This ensures that any file named .gitkeep, regardless of its location,
# is explicitly tracked by Git.
!**/.gitkeep
