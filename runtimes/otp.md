## The beam and associated language and tooling

Included in this toolbox are the latest releases of the Erlang, Elixir and Gleam programming languages.
The Erlang programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language
and **runtime** system. It is used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with high availability.
The BEAM is the virtual machine at the core of the Erlang Open Telecom Platform (OTP).
The included Elixir and Gleam programming languages also run on the BEAM.
BEAM tooling included is the latest versions of the Rebar3 and the Mix build tools.
